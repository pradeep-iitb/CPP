# 🧠 Coding Notes — By Pradeep

Welcome to my code and terminal command notes!  
This file demonstrates how to show **commands**, **code**, and **outputs** neatly in Markdown.

## 🧩 1. Terminal / Shell Commands

Use triple backticks with **bash** for terminal commands.

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update

# Install Python
sudo apt install python3

```
# Check version
python3 --version

```Output:
Hello, Pradeep!
Number 0
Number 1
Number 2
```
